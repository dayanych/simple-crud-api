# Assignment: CRUD API

### Installing:

```npm i```

### Running DEV mode:

```npm run start:dev```

### Running PROD mode:

```npm run start:prod```

## Description

Your task is to implement simple CRUD API using in-memory database underneath.

## Technical requirements

- Task can be implemented on Javascript or Typescript
- Only `nodemon`, `dotenv`, `cross-env`, `typescript`, `ts-node`, `ts-node-dev`, `eslint` and its plugins, `webpack-cli`, `webpack` and its plugins, `prettier`, `uuid`, `@types/*` as well as libraries used for testing are allowed
- Use 20 LTS version of Node.js
- Prefer asynchronous API whenever possible

## Implementation details

1. Implemented endpoint `api/users`:
    - **GET** `api/users` is used to get all persons
        - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and all users records
    - **GET** `api/users/{userId}` 
        - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and record with `id === userId` if it exists
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
    - **POST** `api/users` is used to create record about new user and store it in database
        - Server should answer with `status code` **201** and newly created record
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if request `body` does not contain **required** fields
    - **PUT** `api/users/{userId}` is used to update existing user
        - Server should answer with` status code` **200** and updated record
        - Server should answer with` status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with` status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
    - **DELETE** `api/users/{userId}` is used to delete existing user from database
        - Server should answer with `status code` **204** if the record is found and deleted
        - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
        - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
